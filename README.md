## Apollo Client
- In oder to work with class components I have taken a Hybrid approach in using elements from the apollo v3 as well as apollo v2. 
- Setting up the appolo client in the index.js file as instructed by the documentation (link) since we cannot use functional compoents and therefore cannot use hooks, I ham using the query component from Apollo v2 (Link) to requry datat and render it in the DOM.
